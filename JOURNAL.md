# Easy75
_because sometimes nine keys isn't enough..._

## entry #1 - 5/27

i'm back from vacation! as soon as i got home i got to work creating the first version of easy75. i was able to get the entire schematic and some of the pcb done. here's a preview:

the keyboard is powered by a raspberry pi pico. if i can get my hands on a pico 2 then i'll use that. because i had the OLED screen and needed space to put the MCU, i had to add the extra six keys a little strangely leaving some space, but i think it'll be okay in the end.

when i made hackpad, i found that the hardest part was wiring and adding the LEDs. i haven't done that yet so wish me luck as i navigate this once again!!


## introduction (entry #0 - 5/24)

welcome to my journal for my **THIRD** hack club highway project! this is a custom-designed and built 75% keyboard. the name comes from both my initials (EZ) and the overarching principle that this keyboard should be easy to build. last week I built a macropad from scratch, opening my eyes to the world of custom keyboard PCBs. i want this to be a step up from a macropad but not at the level where I'm hiding the MCU under the spacebar on the reverse side (though i do wish to reach that point someday).

some features i wish to incorporate for this project:
- hotswap
- gasket mount
- per-key RGB
- 1.3" OLED screen (128x64)
- custom firmware that would support n-key rollover
- rotary encoder(s?)
- custom PCB
- lubed switches/stabilizers
- more!

i will use KiCad for designing the schematic and pcb and Onshape to CAD everything. machining the case will be difficult but i will attempt to create something that works out given my limited 3D printer space. maybe i'll even be able to get access to my robotics team's CNC machine. for now, we shall begin designing soon. first i have to go on vacation for a few days...
