_because sometimes nine keys isn't enough..._

## introduction (entry #0 - 5/24)

welcome to my journal for my **THIRD** hack club highway project! this is a custom-designed and built 75% keyboard. the name comes from both my initials (EZ) and the overarching principle that this keyboard should be easy to build. last week I built a macropad from scratch, opening my eyes to the world of custom keyboard PCBs. i want this to be a step up from a macropad but not at the level where I'm hiding the MCU under the spacebar on the reverse side (though i do wish to reach that point someday).

some features i wish to incorporate for this project:
- hotswap
- gasket mount
- per-key RGB
- 1.3" OLED screen (128x64)
- custom firmware that would support n-key rollover
- rotary encoder(s?)
- custom PCB
- lubed switches/stabilizers
- more!

i will use KiCad for designing the schematic and pcb and Onshape to CAD everything. machining the case will be difficult but i will attempt to create something that works out given my limited 3D printer space. maybe i'll even be able to get access to my robotics team's CNC machine. for now, we shall begin designing soon. first i have to go on vacation for a few days...
